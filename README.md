# RickAndMortyApp

This project is a web application that Rick and Morty' characters information and displays their details using the API. The project is developed using modern Angular and Typescript technologies. Bootstrap and CSS(SCSS) were used for interface design.

## Features

- The list of characters is displayed on the main page in the form of cards.

- Each character card includes information such as the name, status, species, gender, and image.

- The filter on the list page allows searching among the characters.

- Clicking on each character card navigates to the details of that character.

- The character detail page displays more detailed information about the  image, name, gender, species, status, location and origin.

- Pagination functionality allows displaying a certain number of character per page.

## Technologies:

- **Angular:**  A modern and fast library for building user interfaces.

- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types to the language.

- **Bootstrap:** A fast and flexible CSS framework, customized for this project to provide quick and simple styling.

- **SCSS:** A more powerful and feature-rich extension of CSS that enables better organization and maintainability of stylesheets.
